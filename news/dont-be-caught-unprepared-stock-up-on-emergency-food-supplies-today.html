These can last for several decades(!) and can be heated in cans or extremely quickly with a pressure cooker. For those who prefer something more natural or organic, freeze-dried options are now widely available. This type of food requires no refrigeration or cooking – simply add hot water for rehydration. Furthermore, energy bars are another popular option due to their light weight and long shelf life. <br />
<br />
In addition to having emergency foods at home, it's always good to have some ‘on-the-go’ snacks such as granola bars or trail mix. You should also consider having MREs (Meal Ready To Eat). These come in individual packages that contain all you need for one meal, including entrée, side dish and even dessert! <br />
<br />

Emergencies can occur at any time, so it's important to make sure your food supply is stored properly. Neglecting to (do) this could lead to spoilage and inedible meals! To help you avoid this (situation), here are some tips on how to store your emergency food supplies: <br />
<br />
Keep them away from heat sources - Heat can cause the ingredients in your food to break down, rendering them useless. Also, try not to store items in direct sunlight. This will help prolong shelf life. <br />
<br />
Additionally, keep foods moisture-free - Moisture can cause mold growth which means you won't be able to eat your supplies. You should use airtight containers or vacuum sealers for best results. <br />
<br />
Further, store foods in a cool place - Keeping items in a warm area may decrease their shelf life and cause them to spoil more quickly. A basement or garage usually works well for this purpose, as they tend to stay cool even during hot summer months! <br />
<br />
Finally, check expiration dates regularly - Inspect the best by date of each item prior to consuming it. If an item has expired or is close to expiring, discard it right away so that you don't run into any problems later on down the line.(sic) To sum up, making sure your emergency food supplies are stored properly is essential if you want them (to remain) fresh and edible! Don't wait until disaster strikes - stock up today and keep yourself prepared!</p><h4>The importance of rotating your emergency food supply regularly </h4><br><p>Don't be caught unprepared - stock up on emergency food supplies today! You never know when disaster or an unexpected event will hit, and it is always important to be prepared. One key aspect of being prepared is having a well-stocked emergency food supply. It's not enough just to have the food, however; you also need to make sure that your stockpile doesn't become obsolete by regularly rotating it. (Rotating your food supply means replacing expired items with new ones.) Not doing so could mean relying on spoiled or rotten food in a time of crisis, which is the last thing that you want! <br />
<br />
Furthermore, the importance of rotating your emergency food supply should not be underestimated. Not only do many perishables have expiration dates, but even non-perishable items can eventually go bad after long periods of time. (For instance, if something has been sitting in storage for years without being used or rotated out, its quality may have decreased over time). Additionally, rotating your emergency food supply keeps things fresh and ensures that you are getting the most nutrition for your money. <br />
<br />
Therefore, don't forget: rotate your emergency food supply regularly! Doing so will help ensure that you are always ready for whatever life throws at you - whether it's a natural disaster or anything else! Plus, it's easy to do and takes very little time - so there's really no excuse not to do it! (In fact, experts suggest setting aside 30 minutes every six months specifically for this purpose!) So don't wait any longer - stock up on emergency food supplies now and start rotating them regularly! It'll give you peace of mind knowing that if and when disaster strikes, you won't be caught unprepared.</p><h4>What to do if you need extra help in stocking up on emergency food supplies  </h4><br><p>Don't be caught unprepared - stock up on emergency food supplies today!
