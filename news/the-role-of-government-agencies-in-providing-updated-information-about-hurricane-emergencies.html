<h4>Introduction </h4><br><p>Introoduction (of Government Agencies in Hurricane Emergencies) <br />
Hurricanes can be devastating and unpredictable disasters! Knowing the latest information is critical for proper preparation and response. Government agencies play an important role in providing updated information about hurricane emergencies to the public.

Secondly, after a hurricane has passed through an area, government agencies will issue advisories with more detailed information about what happened during the storm – wind speeds, rainfall amounts, number of structures damaged or destroyed – so that officials can measure its intensity and take steps to help affected communities recover quickly. Advisories also include safety tips such as not entering flooded areas or being wary of fallen power lines. All these updates help keep citizens informed about potential threats to their safety so they can make informed decisions when faced with emergency situations. <br />
